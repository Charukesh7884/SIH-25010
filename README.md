## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution  
We propose a **multilingual, AI-based mobile and web platform** that delivers tailored crop advisory to small and marginal farmers.

### Key Features  
- **Crop Planning Tool:** Recommends ideal crops based on soil quality, climate data, and market trends  
- **Soil & Fertilizer Advisory:** Uses soil test data to optimize fertilizer usage, reducing costs and environmental harm  
- **Pest/Disease Detection:** Image-based identification using computer vision models  
- **Weather Intelligence:** Integrates weather APIs to send localized alerts for droughts, rainfall, or extreme weather  
- **Market Insights:** Displays real-time mandi prices and trends to help farmers make better selling decisions  
- **Language & Voice Support:** Operates in regional languages with voice interaction for ease of use  
- **Learning Loop:** Collects user feedback to improve advisory accuracy over time  

### Innovation  
Unlike generic solutions, our system is **context-aware, AI-driven, and designed for ease of adoption**, ensuring practical impact at scale.


## Technical Approach  
### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (for Android & iOS apps)  
- **Backend:** Django / FastAPI (Python)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection & recommendation logic  
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API, Government agri-data APIs  
- **Hosting:** AWS / Azure / Google Cloud  

### Development Workflow  
1. Gather initial farmer data (location, soil, crop history)  
2. Run AI models for personalized recommendations  
3. Deliver insights via app, chatbot, and voice assistant  
4. Trigger alerts (weather, market prices) as needed  
5. Capture feedback to improve AI models and user experience  


## Feasibility & Viability  
### Feasibility Factors  
- Growing smartphone penetration in rural India  
- Familiarity with chat-based platforms like WhatsApp  
- Availability of open datasets (soil, weather, mandi prices)  

### Challenges  
- Low digital literacy  
- Weak or inconsistent rural internet access  
- AI model accuracy in diverse agri-contexts  

### Mitigation Strategies  
- Offer regional language + voice interfaces  
- Offline access with scheduled sync  
- Partner with agri-research institutions to enhance datasets and accuracy  


## Expected Impact  
- **Social:** Enables informed decisions, reducing dependency on middlemen  
- **Economic:** Improves yield and profitability by optimizing resource use  
- **Environmental:** Reduces chemical overuse, promotes sustainable practices  
- **Policy:** Assists government in monitoring and planning via collected data
